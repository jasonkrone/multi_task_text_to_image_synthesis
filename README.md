The majority of code in this repository is adapted from the following projects:

* https://github.com/taoxugit/AttnGAN

* https://github.com/Cyanogenoid/pytorch-vqa

* https://github.com/sbarratt/inception-score-pytorch

If you find that our code is relivant to your use case, it is highly likely that one of the implementations above will be a cleaner and more concise implementation to build on.
